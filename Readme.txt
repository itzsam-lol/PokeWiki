PokeWiki 
- This application is made to find any Pokemon details either by giving a name/ID or randomly generating any Pokemon.
You can also view the temperature of Japan (specifically Japan, as the Pokemon series is from that country only) at the bottom, which updates automatically.

Usage- 
You can generate pokemon details randomly by clicking the random pokemon button provided at the bottom.
If you want to specifically search for any pokemon you heard in the show or heard from any freind you can search it from the search menu by providing correct name(correct spell) else a pop up will appear that the pokemon doesn't exists.
There is also an option to search pokemon from their IDs which can be known through pokeApi or other 3rd party websites.
You can access the weather anytime as it is shown in the footer section all time.
